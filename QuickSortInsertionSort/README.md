Sorting algorithms running time empirical study
============


This is an empirical study of the running time of different Sorting algorithms that we developed for the Algorithms course in my sophomore year of my BS in computer science at UDC (Spain). The given pseudocode is the following (InsertionSort and QuickSort):

For every version, we checked the running times of an upper bound , a lower bound and a tight bound as n grows. This table is one of the cases, where  t(n)/h(n) tends to infinity, t(n)/g(n) to a constant and t(n)/f(n) to 0 correspondingly.
