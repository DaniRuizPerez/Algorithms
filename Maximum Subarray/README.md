Fibonacci implementations running time empirical study
============


This is an empirical study of the running time of different Fibonacci implementations that I developed for the Algorithms course in my sophomore year of my BS in computer science at UDC (Spain). Implemented are the naive recursive version (fib1), the iterative version (fib2) and a more efficient version (fib3)

For every version, we checked the running times of an upper bound , a lower bound and a tight bound as n grows. This table is one of the cases, where  t(n)/h(n) tends to infinity, t(n)/g(n) to a constant and t(n)/f(n) to 0 correspondingly.
