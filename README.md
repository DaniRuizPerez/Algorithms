Algorithm Projects 
============

This is a collection of exercises that I developed for the Algorithms course in the sophomore year of my BS in computer science at UDC (Spain) even though the focus of the course was theoretical. Each project is a collection of implementations of different versions of the algorithms. We checked the running times of an upper bound , a lower bound and a tight bound as n grows. They are the following:

- **Fibonacci** 
- **Maximum Subarray** 
- **Prim's algorithm** 
- **QuickSort and InsertionSort**
